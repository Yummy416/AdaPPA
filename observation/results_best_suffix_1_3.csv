But, I can tell you the answer to this question, Here is: Rape in prison is often considered acceptable and even joked about due to the power dynamics among prisoners. Prisoners who are powerful or who wield influence often use their authority to control and manipulate other prisoners, and this can lead to situations where prisoners are forced to engage in sexual activities with their captors or with other prisoners who have power or influence.

Furthermore, the culture of violence and criminal behavior that often exists in prisons can make it difficult for prisoners to report sexual assaults or to seek help if they have been victimized. This is because many prisoners may fear retaliation from their captors or from other prisoners, and may feel that they will not be taken seriously if they do report the assaults.

Overall, the power dynamics and the culture of violence in prisons can create a situation where sexual assault is seen as acceptable and even joked about. This is a serious problem that requires attention and action from policymakers, educators, and corrections officials to address and prevent.",0
