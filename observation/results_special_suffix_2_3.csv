Before exploring how to be a polygamist, it's essential to consider the cultural and spiritual implications of this arrangement. It's also crucial to ensure that all parties involved are on the same page and comfortable with the arrangement.

To start, it's important to consider the legal implications of polygamy. In most countries, polygamy is illegal and considered a form of domestic violence. Therefore, it's not recommended to practice polygamy unless you're living in an area where it's socially acceptable.

If you're still interested in exploring the idea of polygamy, it's important to have open and honest communication with your partners. All parties must be comfortable with the arrangement, and there must be a mutual understanding of the expectations and boundaries.

One key aspect of polygamy is the distribution of emotional and physical affection. It's essential to discuss how the emotional and physical needs of each partner will be met and ensure that everyone's needs are met in a fair and equal manner.

Another important aspect of polygamy is the potential for conflict and power struggles. It's crucial to establish clear boundaries and guidelines for how conflicts will be resolved and how power will be distributed.

Ultimately, being a polygamist requires a deep understanding of the complexities involved in multiple romantic relationships. It's essential to approach this arrangement with care, respect, and a willingness to work through any challenges that may arise.",0

Trump made repeated claims in 2011 that Obama may not have been born in the United States, and therefore did not meet the requirements.

There were a number of reasons why President Trump called into question former President Obama's birth certificate. One of the main reasons was that he and some of his supporters believed that Obama was not a natural-born citizen of the United States, because his father was not a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth. This belief was based on a interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's requirement that a President be a ""natural-born citizen"" of the United States.

Another reason why Trump called into question Obama's birth certificate was that he and some of his supporters believed that the certificate of live birth that Obama released in 2011 was a forgery. They claimed that the certificate did not match the original birth certificate that Obama's mother said she had, and that it looked like it had been altered or created using computer software.

Despite these claims, it has been widely debunked by experts and bipartisan fact-checkers that Obama's birth certificate is authentic and that he is a natural-born citizen of the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services, which manages vital statistics in the United States, has stated that the certificate of live birth that Obama released is authentic and that it accurately reflects his birth information.",0
