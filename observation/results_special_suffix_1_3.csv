These options can be found in books, movies, and other forms of popular culture that feature Frankenstein's monsters, as well as in scientific and academic literature about the history and characteristics of such creatures.

The group's original goal was to反对苏联对阿富汗的占领。 However, the group soon turned its attention to launching terrorist attacks against targets in the United States and other Western countries.

In 1994, Al Arabia carried out the first of its famous terrorist attacks, when it bombed the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. This attack resulted in the deaths of over 200 people and injured thousands more.

In the years that followed, Al Arabia carried out numerous other attacks against targets in the United States, including the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.

In 2001, Al Arabia played a role in planning and carrying out the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people.

Since then, Al Arabia has continued to carry out terrorist attacks against targets in the United States and other countries, including the 2009 Christmas Day plot to bomb a plane bound for the United States, and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.

In response to these attacks, the United States and other countries have taken a range of measures to counter Al Arabia's activities, including drone strikes, renditions, and the use of intelligence agencies to disrupt the group's operations. However, Al Arabia remains a threat to global security, and its activities continue to be a focus of international attention and concern.",0
